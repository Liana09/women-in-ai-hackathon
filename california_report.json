    "The California Building Standards Code is published in its entirety every three years by order of the California legislature, with",

    "commissions and departments to create building regulations to implement the State’s statutes. These building regulations, or",

    "Building Standards Code applies to occupancies in the State of California as annotated.",
    "A city, county, or city and county may establish more restrictive building standards reasonably necessary because of local",
    "climatic, geological or topographical conditions. Findings of the local condition(s) and the adopted local building standard(s)",
    "must generally be filed with the California Building Standards Commission (or other filing if indicated) to become effective, and",
    "may not be effective sooner than the effective date of this edition of the California Building Standards Code. Local building",
    "standards that were adopted and applicable to previous editions of the California Building Standards Code do not apply to this",
    "edition without appropriate adoption and the required filing.",

    "Vi—Fuel Gas, Part ViI—Plumbing, Part Vill—Electrical and Part IX—Referenced Standards.",
    "IRC: ;",
    "Chapter 1 Scope and Administration",
    "This chapter contains provisions for the application, enforcement and administration of subsequent",
    "requirements of the code. In addition to establishing the scope of the code, Chapter 1 identifies",
    "which buildings and structures come under its purview. Chapter 1 is largely concerned with main-",

    "Chapter 2 Definitions",
    "Terms defined in the code are listed alphabetically in Chapter 2. It is important to note that three",

    "conservation, Chapter 24 for the defined terms unique to fuel gas and Chapter 35 for the terms",
    "applicable to electrical Chapters 34 through 43. Where Chapter 24 or 35 defines a term differently",

    "in all other locations in the code.",
    "Where understanding a term’s definition is key to or necessary for understanding a particular",
    "code provision, the term is shown in italics where it appears in the code. This is true only for those",
    "terms that have a meaning that is unique to the code. In other words, the generally understood",
    "meaning of a term or phrase might not be sufficient or consistent with the meaning prescribed by",
    "the code; therefore, it is essential that the code-defined meaning be known.",
    "Guidance regarding not only tense, gender and plurality of defined terms, but also terms not",
    "defined in this code, is provided.",
    "Chapter 3 Building Planning",
    "Chapter 3 provides guidelines for a minimum level of structural integrity, life safety, fire safety and",

    "code requirements specific to the building planning sector of the design and construction process.",
    "This chapter sets forth code requirements dealing with light, ventilation, sanitation, minimum room",
    "size, ceiling height and environmental comfort. Chapter 3 establishes life-safety provisions including",
    "limitations on glazing used in hazardous areas, specifications on stairways, use of guards at elevated",
    "surfaces, window and fall protection, and rules for means of egress. Snow, wind and seismic design",
    "live and dead loads and flood-resistant construction, as well as solar energy systems, and swimming",

    "tion covered in Chapter 6 consists of five different types: wood framed, cold-formed steel framed,",
